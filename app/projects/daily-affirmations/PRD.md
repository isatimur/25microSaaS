# Product Requirements Document: Daily Affirmations Chrome Extension

## 1. Introduction

The Daily Affirmations Chrome Extension is designed to provide users with a moment of positivity and reflection each time they open a new tab. It replaces the standard new tab page with a clean interface displaying an uplifting affirmation, a beautiful background image, and simple customization options.

## 2. Goals

-   Provide a simple, non-intrusive way for users to receive daily positive affirmations.
-   Enhance the new tab experience with a visually appealing and calming interface.
-   Allow users to personalize the experience to their preferences.
-   Keep the extension lightweight and fast.

## 3. Target Audience

-   Individuals seeking motivation and a positive mindset.
-   Users who appreciate minimalist design and calming visuals.
-   People looking to integrate small moments of mindfulness into their daily digital routine.
-   Chrome browser users.

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Core Features

-   **Display Daily Affirmation:** Show a new affirmation each day or each time a new tab is opened (configurable).
    -   Affirmations should be sourced from a predefined list.
    -   Ability to cycle through affirmations.
-   **Background Image:** Display a high-quality, calming background image.
    -   Images should be sourced from a predefined collection or a dynamic source (e.g., Unsplash API, local collection).
    -   Ability to cycle through background images.
-   **Time Display:** Show the current time.
-   **Search Bar:** Optional Google search bar integrated into the page.

### 4.2 Customization Features

-   **Toggle Time Display:** Users can choose to show or hide the time.
-   **Toggle Search Bar:** Users can choose to show or hide the search bar.
-   **Affirmation Categories (Future Scope):** Allow users to select categories of affirmations (e.g., gratitude, success, self-love).
-   **Custom Backgrounds (Future Scope):** Allow users to upload their own background images or link to specific online images.
-   **Font Customization (Future Scope):** Allow users to change font style and size for affirmations.

### 4.3 Technical Features

-   **Lightweight & Fast:** The extension should load quickly and not consume excessive system resources.
-   **Offline Access:** Core features (displaying affirmations from a preloaded list, time) should work offline. Background images might require caching or a default offline image.
-   **Secure:** No unnecessary user data collection. If an API is used for images, ensure it's done securely.

## 5. Design & UI/UX

-   **Interface:** Clean, minimalist, and visually calming.
-   **Affirmation Text:** Clearly legible, centered on the page.
-   **Background Image:** Should not obstruct the affirmation text (e.g., by using a text shadow, overlay, or choosing appropriate images).
-   **Settings/Customization:** Accessible via a discreet icon (e.g., a gear icon) that opens a simple settings panel.

## 6. Monetization (Future Scope)

-   **Premium Version:**
    -   Access to exclusive affirmation categories.
    -   More background image options or integration with more sources.
    -   Advanced customization features (fonts, custom backgrounds).
-   **Non-intrusive Ads:** Potentially a small, unobtrusive ad if other monetization fails, but this is highly undesirable for the user experience.
-   **Affiliate Links:** For related products or services if contextually relevant and non-intrusive.

## 7. Success Metrics

-   Number of active daily users.
-   User retention rate.
-   Ratings and reviews on the Chrome Web Store.
-   Minimal uninstalls.
-   Load time of the new tab page.
